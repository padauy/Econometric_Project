## Introduction

::: {.justify}

The sinking of the Titanic stands as a pivotal event in history, prompting extensive scholarly investigation into the factors influencing passenger survival. This project utilizes the titanic.csv dataset, accessible at https://stanford.io/2O9RUCF, to scrutinize socioeconomic variables and identify patterns contributing to survival, treating it as a binary outcome.

Our objectives include data exploration and visualization, analyzing age density distributions conditioned on survival to ascertain its predictive value. Subsequently, we employ modeling techniques such as the linear probability model, logistic regression, and probit regression to explore nuanced relationships between survival and socioeconomic factors.

### Data
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggThemeAssist)
library(corrplot)
library(AER)


Titanic_2 <- read_csv("https://stanford.io/2O9RUCF")
summary(Titanic_2)

```

In the dataset, we observe information for 887 passengers distributed across 8 columns. Notably, the "Survived" column contains binary data, taking the value of 1 if the individual survived and 0 otherwise. The "PClass" column indicates the class in which the individual traveled, with three distinct classes available. The "Name" column is deemed irrelevant for our analysis. Additionally, key demographic details include the passenger's gender ("Sex"), age ("Age"), the presence of siblings aboard ("Siblings"), the count of parents aboard ("Parents"), and the cost of the ticket in British pounds ("Fare").


The bar chart illustrates the relative proportions of survivors and casualties based on gender. Among females, a higher proportion survived, while among males, a greater number experienced fatalities.

```{r}
Titanic_2 <- Titanic_2[, -3]
colnames(Titanic_2) <- c("Survived", "Class", "Sex", "Age", "Siblings", "Parents", "Fare")

t_abs <-table(Titanic_2$Survived, Titanic_2$Class)

# CORRELATION BETWEEN

corrplot(cor(select_if(Titanic_2, is.numeric)))
```


As evident from the preceding plot, it is notable that the most pronounced correlation exists between the fare and passenger class. This correlation suggests a discernible pattern that can be anticipated or forecasted.

We can employ density estimates to examine the distribution of age conditional on survival and the distribution of class on survival. This analysis aims to discern potential indications of how age and class are associated with the likelihood of survival. Notably, despite the dataset reporting ages as integers, we treat age as a continuous variable in this context. An intriguing aspect to explore is whether there are observable patterns that shed light on the effectiveness of the 'women and children first' policy in influencing survival outcomes.

```{r}
#| echo: false
# generate `t_rel`, the table of the relative frequencies
t_rel <- t_abs/nrow(Titanic_2)

data <- as.data.frame(table(Titanic_2$Survived, Titanic_2$Class)/nrow(Titanic_2))
colnames(data) <- c("Survived", "Class", "Frequency")

# Cambiar el orden de los factores en el eje y
data$Survived <- factor(data$Survived, levels = c(1,0))

# relative frequencies of survival (plot)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Class, y = Frequency, fill = Survived)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack", width = 0.7) +
        scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkgreen", "darkred")) +
        labs(title = "Relative Frequencies of Survival",
             x = "Class",
             y = "Relative Frequency") +
        ylim(0, 0.6) +
        theme_minimal()

```

Analyzing the preceding graph, it is evident that approximately 20% of the passengers belonged to the first class, another 20% to the second class, with nearly half of them unfortunately not surviving. In contrast, passengers in the third class constituted just under 60%, and regrettably, almost 80% of them did not survive, representing 40% of the total passengers.

```{r}
#data1 <- Titanic_2 %>%
 #   group_by(Survived, Sex) %>%
  #  summarize(Frequency = n()) %>%
   # group_by(Sex) %>%
    ##mutate(Proportion = Frequency / sum(Frequency))
#
#
#
## Cambiar el orden de los factores en el eje y
#

# Crear el gráfico de barras apiladas

#ggplot(data1, aes(x = Sex, y = Proportion, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
 #   geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack", width = 0.7) +
  #  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#009AFF", "#022E4B")) +
   # labs(title = "Frequency of Survival by Gender",
    #     x = "Sex",
     #    y = "Frequency",
      #   fill = "Survived") +
    #theme_minimal()
# Mostrar el gráfico
data1 <- Titanic_2 %>%
    group_by(Survived, Sex) %>%
    summarize(Frequency = n()) %>%
    group_by(Sex) %>%
    mutate(Proportion = Frequency / sum(Frequency))



# Cambiar el orden de los factores en el eje y

# Convertir Proportion a factor

# Crear el gráfico de barras apiladas

ggplot(data1, aes(x = Sex, y = Proportion, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack", width = 0.7) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("#009AFF", "#022E4B")) +
    labs(title = "Frequency of Survival by Gender",
         x = "Sex",
         y = "Frequency",
         fill = "Survived") +
    theme_minimal()


```

The bar chart illustrates the relative proportion of survival and mortality based on gender. Among females, a higher proportion survived( about 75%), while among males, a greater proportion did not survive(less than 25%).


Density estimates are employed to analyze the distribution of Age conditioned on survival, aiming to discern any indications of how age may be related to the likelihood of survival.
```{r}

# DENSITY DISTRIBUTION 

# Estimate both densities
dens_age_surv <- density(Titanic_2$Age[Titanic_2$Survived == 1])
dens_age_died <- density(Titanic_2$Age[Titanic_2$Survived == 0])

# Combine data into a single data frame for ggplot
data <- data.frame(
        x = c(dens_age_surv$x, dens_age_died$x),
        y = c(dens_age_surv$y, dens_age_died$y),
        group = rep(c("Survived", "Died"), each = length(dens_age_surv$x))
)

# Find the maximum y value for setting ylim
max_y <- max(data$y)

# Create ggplot with a more appealing style
g<-ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) +
        geom_line(size = 1.5) +
        ylim(0, max_y * 1.1) +  # Adjust ylim to accommodate the highest density
        labs(
                title = "Density Estimates of 'Age'",
                x = "Age",
                y = "Density",
                caption = "Data source: Titanic_2"
        ) +
        scale_color_manual(values = c("Survived" = "#C4961A", "Died" = "#576d8d")) +
        theme_minimal() +
        theme(
                plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
                axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
                axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
                legend.title = element_blank(),
                legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
        ) + theme(axis.line = element_line(size = 0.5,
    linetype = "solid"), axis.ticks = element_line(linetype = "dashed")) +labs(caption = "Chart crafted by the author.")

```

From the preceding graph, it is evident that passengers below the age of 9 had a higher likelihood of survival, whereas individuals around the age of 20 had a greater likelihood of not surviving.


The analysis of age distribution unveils the contrasting proportions of passengers who survived and those who did not. Illustrated in the subsequent graph, children, especially those aged 0 to 5, displayed a remarkably high survival rate. Conversely, in the higher age bracket, particularly between 50 and 70, the mortality rate is notably elevated, save for a remarkable exception – an 80-year-old passenger who survived.

```{r}
ggplot(Titanic_2, aes(x = Age, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5)+labs(fill = "Survived", caption = "Survived = 1; Not Survived = 0")
```
In the upcoming graph, we will employ a histogram to depict the survival rate based on age, class, and sex.

```{r}
ggplot(Titanic_2, aes(x = Age, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(Sex ~ Class) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(fill = "Survived", caption = "Survived = 1; Not Survived = 0")
```

Females in the first class exhibited an exceptionally high rate of survivability as in the second class. However, females in the third class experienced notably lower survivability.

Conversely, among males, the survival rate was highest in the first class, followed by the second class. The survival rate for males in the third class was markedly low.

## A Linear Probability Model for Survival 

How do socio-economic characteristics of the passagers impact the probability of survival?
In particular, are there systematic differences between the three passagers classes? Do the data reflect the "children and women first" policy?

We are going to start the analysis by estimating a simple linear probability model like (LMP)

$$Survived_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1Class2_i + \beta_2Class3_i + \mu_i$$

Where $Class2$ and $Class3$ are dummy variables

```{r}
#  A Linear Probability Model for Survival I

#encode "Class" as a factor

Titanic_2$Class <- as.factor(Titanic_2$Class)

#model
surv_mod <- lm(Survived ~ Class, data =Titanic_2)

# Robust summary 

coeftest(surv_mod,vcovHC)

# predict the probability of survival for all passenger classes
predict(surv_mod, newdata = data.frame("Class" = as.factor(1:3)))


```

$$ \hat{Survived_i} = 0,63 - 0,16Class2_i - 0,39Class3_i + \mu_i$$
Based on this model, we can infer that the notably significant coefficients indicate a decline in the probability of survival associated with the passenger class. Specifically, passengers from a less affluent class are less likely to survive. Breaking it down further, the survival probabilities are 62.96% for first class, 47.28% for second class, and 24.43% for third class passengers.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge that this result may be influenced by omitted variable bias, stemming from the correlation of passenger class with determinants of survival probability not considered in the model. To address this potential bias, we augment the model to incorporate all remaining variables as additional regressors.

```{r}
surv_prob_c1 <- surv_mod$coefficients[1]  
surv_prob_c2 <- surv_prob_c1 + surv_mod$coefficients[2]  
surv_prob_c3 <- surv_prob_c1 + surv_mod$coefficients[3]  

LPM_mod <- lm(Survived ~ ., data = Titanic_2)

coeftest(LPM_mod, vcovHC)
```


Following this analysis, it becomes apparent that certain variables, namely sexmale, age, and siblings, are found to be statistically significant. These variables were omitted in the previous model but are now recognized as having a meaningful impact on the outcomes.

## Logit

Logistic regression, also known as Logit regression, is a more appropriate method than Linear Probability Model (LPM) for modeling the conditional probability function of a dichotomous outcome variable. Unlike the LPM, logistic regression employs a nonlinear link function that constrains the fitted values to fall within the range of 0 to 1. Specifically, in logistic regression, the log-odds of the outcome are modeled as a linear combination of predictors, while the LPM assumes linearity in the conditional probability function of the outcome.

$$ \begin{multlined}
log \biggl(\frac{P (Survived_i=1)}{1-P(Survived_i=1)}\biggr) = \beta_0 + \beta_1Class2_i + \beta_2Class3_i + \beta_3 Sex_i + \\ \beta_4 Age_i  + \beta_5 Siblings_i + \beta_6 Parents_i +\beta_7 Fare_i + \mu_i 
\end{multlined}$$

```{r}
Logit_mod <- glm(Survived ~ ., 
                 family = binomial(link = "logit"), 
                 data = Titanic_2)

# obtain a robust summary of the model coefficients
coeftest(Logit_mod, vcovHC)

#new_data <- data.frame(Class = Logit_mod$model$Class)

# predict the probability of survival for the hypothecial individuals
#predict(Logit_mod, newdata = new_data, type = "response")

```

We note that all variables exert a consistent negative influence on the probability of survival, mirroring the patterns observed in the linear model. The variables that demonstrated significance in the linear model maintain their significance in this context, while those that were not significant in the linear model also lack significance here.

### Marginal Effect

Marginal effects denote the change in probability when the predictor or independent variable increases by one unit. For continuous variables, this signifies the instantaneous change, acknowledging that the 'unit' may be very small. In the case of binary variables, the change is from 0 to 1, constituting one 'unit' as conventionally understood.
```{r}
library(mfx)

logitmfx(Survived ~ ., data = Titanic_2)

```

## Probit

$$ 
\begin{multlined}
P(Survived = 1 | Class2_i, Class3_i,...,Fare_i) = \Phi (\beta_0 + \beta_1Class2_i + \\ \beta_2Class3_i + \beta_3 Sex_i + \beta_4 Age_i + \beta_5 Siblings_i + \beta_6 Parents_i +\beta_7 Fare_i + \mu_i)
\end{multlined}
$$
```{r}
## PROBIT 


# fit the Probit model, assign it to `Probit_mod`
Probit_mod <- glm(Survived ~ ., family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = Titanic_2)

# obtain a robust summary of the model coefficients
coeftest(Probit_mod, vcovHC)

# predict the probability of survival for the hypothecial individuals
#predict(Probit_mod, newdata = data.frame("Sexmale" = as.factor(1:2)))


```

The findings here align closely with those observed in the logistic regression model.

### Conclusions

In summary, our exploration of the Titanic dataset reveals a poignant story of societal dynamics during a tragic event. Passenger class emerges as a key determinant, impacting survival odds significantly. The age-old ethos of "women and children first" echoes in the data, with children aged 0 to 5 symbolizing resilience.

Gender plays a crucial role, showcasing higher survival rates among women. As we delve into statistical models, variables like sex, age, and familial ties consistently influence survival chances. The correlation between passenger class and survival, the nuanced impact of age, and gender-specific dynamics enrich our understanding of the Titanic tragedy.
